            ​ Magikarp's frame was designed on a small budget. It is made of
            waterjetted polycarbonate sheets with t-slot aluminum rails for
            structure. Magikarp has two 4" acrylic waterproof enclosures: the
            bottom enclosure houses the battery and camera, while the top
            enclosure houses the electronics. The bottom enclosure features a
            clear dome endcap for the camera, and all other endcaps have
            penetrators for feeding through wires for peripherals.

            ​The electrical system on Magikarp is very minimal. It consists of a
            thruster ESC board that handles the kill switch and signals/power to
            the thrusters, an arduino board running the stabilization
            controllers, a LattePanda computer for ROS and computer vision, a
            sensor suite, and a buck converter for stepping down voltage from
            the batteries for the computer and microcontroller. Its sensor suite
            included a camera, an IMU, and a barometer. The stabilization
            controller on Magikarp is a simple PID system, with a set of gains
            that apply to yaw, pitch, and roll, collectively, and a separate set
            of gains for depth control. The entire submarine is powered by a
            single 10Ah, 14.8V LiPo battery.{" "}

            Since Magikarp is only equipped with two devices that can
            communicate (the motherboard and an Arduino board), the ROS
            architecture on the motherboard consists of only 3 nodes - a
            computer vision node, a movement command node, and the Arduino node
            that outputs signals to the motors. During the competition, Magikarp
            did not have object detection capabilities, so only two nodes were
            used for movement commands.{" "}
