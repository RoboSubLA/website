          <h3 className='resources-section-h3'>What is RoboSub?</h3>
          <p className='resources-section-p'>
          RoboSub is an international student competition. Student teams from around the world design and build robotic submarines, otherwise known as Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV). The behaviors demonstrated by these experimental AUVs mimics those of real-world systems, currently deployed around the world for underwater exploration, seafloor mapping, and sonar localization, amongst many others.
          </p>

          <h3 className='resources-section-h3'>The Competition</h3>
          <p className='resources-section-p'>Assemble your team and get busy designing, building and testing the sub-systems of your AUV. Now put it all together and demonstrate your vehicles autonomy by completing a series of tasks through a pre-defined mission.</p>

          <p className='resources-section-p'>Our team is split up into two project teams, the student organization and the senior design team. The senior design team builds one vehicle, and the club members build a separate vehicle while being mentored by senior design members. Both vehicles are intended for use in the competition and strategies will be carefully considered based on the capabilities of both vehicles. Members have the opportunity to design advanced robotics systems and work on an interdisciplinary project to gain experience working with a team. Please see the progress tab for a better idea of what our members are working on and what tasks and projects are available to new members</p>

                 The team creates schematics for the functionality of buck converters (converters that are able to efficiently let high voltage convert into low voltages in order to extend battery life and reduce heat. In turn, this has allowed many smaller appliances to spring into everyday use.)

				  The Controls Team is responsible for making the AUV respond to movement
				  instructions. Because the AUV is autonomous, the controls won't be manually

				  the Controls subteam or another computer science subteam must make, in order
				  to debug the code and test the controls.

				  The Autonomy team is responsible for writing the state machine 
				  of the AUV. The state machine determines what the AUV is doing at any time,
				  and it's very important when deciding what to do next. For example,
				  an AUV might have a state that tells it to follow a path. In this
				  state, the AUV will continue to follow this path until the state is
				  changed. Basically, the state machine determines when the AUV should
				  transition to this state, when it should stick to this state, and when
				  it should transition to another state. If the AUV has reached the end
				  of a path, then something has to be called by the state machine to tell
				  the AUV to transition to the next state, which might tell the AUV to stop
				  or do another task, depending on what the competition wants the AUV to do.

				  The Computer Vision team is responsible for making the AUV recognize objects 
				  with its camera. So, one of the most important tasks of the CV team is object
				  detection, which can be done with software. This year YOLO (You only look once)
				  will be used for the CV software. YOLO is a machine learning (deep learning)
				  algorithm that is used in object detection.
