          <p className='linux-h1'> What is Linux </p>
          <p className='linux-p'> Just like Windows, iOS, and Mac OS, Linux is an operating system. In fact, one of the most popular platforms on the planet, Android, is powered by the Linux operating system. An operating system is software that manages all of the hardware resources associated with your desktop or laptop. To put it simply, the operating system manages the communication between your software and your hardware. Without the operating system (OS), the software wouldnt function? </p>
          <p className='linux-h3'>The Linux operating system comprises several different pieces:</p>

          <ListGroup>
            <ListGroup.Item>Bootloader –  The software that manages the boot process of your computer. For most users, this will simply be a splash screen that pops up and eventually goes away to boot into the operating system.</ListGroup.Item>
            <ListGroup.Item>Kernel – This is the one piece of the whole that is actually called ?Linux?. The kernel is the core of the system and manages the CPU, memory, and peripheral devices. The kernel is the lowest level of the OS.</ListGroup.Item>
            <ListGroup.Item>Init system – This is a sub-system that bootstraps the user space and is charged with controlling daemons. One of the most widely used init systems is systemd? which also happens to be one of the most controversial. It is the init system that manages the boot process, once the initial booting is handed over from the bootloader (i.e., GRUB or GRand Unified Bootloader).</ListGroup.Item>
            <ListGroup.Item>Daemons – These are background services (printing, sound, scheduling, etc.) that either start up during boot or after you log into the desktop.</ListGroup.Item>
            <ListGroup.Item>Graphical server – This is the sub-system that displays the graphics on your monitor. It is commonly referred to as the X server or just X.</ListGroup.Item>
            <ListGroup.Item>Desktop environment – This is the piece that the users actually interact with. There are many desktop environments to choose from (GNOME, Cinnamon, Mate, Pantheon, Enlightenment, KDE, Xfce, etc.). Each desktop environment includes built-in applications (such as file managers, configuration tools, web browsers, and games).</ListGroup.Item>
            <ListGroup.Item>Applications – Desktop environments do not offer the full array of apps. Just like Windows and macOS, Linux offers thousands upon thousands of high-quality software titles that can be easily found and installed. Most modern Linux distributions (more on this below) include App Store-like tools that centralize and simplify application installation. For example, Ubuntu Linux has the Ubuntu Software Center (a rebrand of GNOME Software? Figure 1) which allows you to quickly search among the thousands of apps and install them from one centralized location.</ListGroup.Item>

              <p className='linux-h1'> Virtualization </p>
              <p className='linux-p'>
              Virtualization involves installing an emulator to run an instance
              of the Linux os inside a window on a host computer. The main
              benifit of this type of install is the ability to add and remove
              various versions of OS's without the need of making any major
              change to your hard drive. It is the easiest to implement. The
              downsides include needing at least 8gb of ram for the set up we
              are running, as well as needing different install software
              depending on your native OS. In addition the computer vision
              software requirements are different, and running those algorithms
              might produce unexpected results, or refuse to run altogether.
              Still a great choice if Linus is new to you and want to try it out
              risk free.

    //         <h2>Hard Drive Partitioning</h2>
    //         <p>
    //           This method involves partitioning your hard drive on the host
    //           computer to allow seperate OS's to be installed on the same drive.
    //           It has the least computer requirements, as Linux is installed on
    //           the hard drive and uses all host resources. Partitioning is
    //           potentially risky as there is a possibility of deleting your
    //           operating system but as long as you are paying attention and
    //           following steps there should be no problems.
